## creation of user AI
Not using server approach because it is too technical for our specific audience.
### inline editor
- textarea
- on submit eval code which returns a function.
- function is ran in Robot.move

### nodejs server with DevTools
Make a node server which serves up a specific level.  This level will have a skeleton of code where the user will program the AI. They will make a workspace and create a network mapping. This way they have the full power of devTools.
